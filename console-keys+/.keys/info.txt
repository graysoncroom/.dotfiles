    Save your current keyboard layout
    $ dumpkeys > backup.kmap

    In case something goes wrong you might be able restore your keymap like so
    $ sudo loadkeys backup.kmap

    If the keyboard is so messed up that you can't even do this then your only option not involving ancient kernel magic is to reboot.

    Run the following command and press the desired key to obtain it's keycode.
    $ showkey

    Note the previous keycode of the keys by parsing the dumpkeys file.
    $ less backup.kmap

    Note the keymap line from dumpkeys:
    $ dumpkeys | head -1
    keymaps 0-127

    Create a keymap file which switches two keys.
    keymaps 0-127
    keycode   1 = CtrlL_Lock
    keycode  58 = Escape

    Load the keymap:
    $ sudo loadkeys swap_esc_capslock.kmap
