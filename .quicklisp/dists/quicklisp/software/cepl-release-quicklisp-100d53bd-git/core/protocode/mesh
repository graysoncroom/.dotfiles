Mesh

set of points

a relationship applied to the points (which defined vertices in this case)

a data-view which describes a layout of the data and relationships in memory.

applying a data-view to the members and relationship creates a datastructure in memory
this could be a no-op if the source already is in the correct for (we can declare this
to be the case)

----------

ephemeral - conceptual only, the relationship is ephemeral
concreate - the relationship has to be stored in memory in some way
            this is the concreate representation of the idea

set - ephemeral
data - concrete

ephemerals are backed by a concrete instance

hehe and we just reinvented types, but we do need to look into data layour transforms between types
can these be generated? what research has been done on this?
