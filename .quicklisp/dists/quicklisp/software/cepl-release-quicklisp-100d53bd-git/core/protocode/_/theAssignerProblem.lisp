;; struct: for each field create an assigner (field may be an array)

;; uniforms: ((test jam 5))
;; paths: test[0].a test[2].b[1].d  test[i].b[0].e[i]

;; need: all of test[*]

;; We could be wrong, this is always a possibility when other compilers
;; are ahead of ours (which will be most of the time!) So maybe we need
;; to do the stupid version, create an assigner for EVERY part of EVERY
;; element of the uniforms and then only use them if the uniform is given
;; AND there is a cached position. The positions still get set at runtime.
;; We have certainty of coverage. Complex uniforms balloon pipeline code
;; but it will all be hidden...it's not too basd actually this will
;; probably be the safest place to start just so we can get moving on a
;; working release again.

;; From glwiki: The maximum number of available locations within a single
