;; well holy crap we can make this faster...much faster
;; Ok so lets declare inline the dispatch function, and make the key args
;; regular args. This means a much higher chance sbcl can optimize away the
;; when forms.
;; later we need to measure this and work out if taking dispatch out of the
;; closure can improve this. This may mean making dedicated functions to
;; return the uniform-ids and program-id

;; Also how do we minimize when we upload uniforms? samplers also need reworking
