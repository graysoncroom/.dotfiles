A node is the most minimal premade spacial entity in cepl

It has the following:
- position
- orientation (quaternion)
- parent-space
- optional space - this is kept up to data when position or orientation change
                   used for spacial hierarchy. No children are defined here.
                   if they want a spacial relationship the subscribe to the
                   parent space.
