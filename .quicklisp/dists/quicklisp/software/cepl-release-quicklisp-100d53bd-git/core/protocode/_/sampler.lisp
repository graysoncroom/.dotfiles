;; Ok, I worked it out!
;; All textures will have a fixnum slot for sampler-id.
;; This will almost always be zero
;; with-sampling will set the internal sampler value of the texture and set
;; it back to zero at the end of the block.
;;
;; With this we take the value into the dispatch functions and can use it.
;; BOOM, solved.
