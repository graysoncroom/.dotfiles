;; kind of want 1st to be an exising fbo -OR- some local one
;; I guess this is why I got confused with defpipeline as I wanted some
;; way to have this done for me.

;; hey... each form could have a third arg...still cant make a closure without
;; owning the function

;; ok so before I go wrong again, on the walk home I decided that g-> would be
;; for composing pipelines unless inside defpipeline. In that case it was for
;; composing g-functions into pipelines.

;; Now I am thinking that if you use let syntax you are combining pipelines
;; so:

(defpipeline first-pass (g-> #'a #'b))
(defpipeline second-pass (g-> #'a #'c))
(defpipeline third-pass (g-> #'d #'e)) ;; this is composing g-funcs

(defpipeline compound
    (g-> (1st (first-pass stream)) ;; and this is composing pipelines
         (2nd (second-pass stream))
         (third-pass quad :t1 (col 1st) :t2 (col 2nd))))

;; need a way of indicating where the fbos are 'from'. Meaning if they
;; are in a closure over the pipeline or are passed in as arguments

;; third arg of let form could indicate the 'from' part:
;; t meaning create a default fbo
;; or just make fbo args... cool

(defpipeline compound
    (g-> (1st (first-pass stream) t) ;; and this is composing pipelines
         (2nd (second-pass stream) (:c (v! 10 20)))
         (third-pass quad :t1 (col 1st) :t2 (col 2nd))))

;; or use :resources

(defpipeline compound
    (g-> (1st (first-pass stream) t) ;; and this is composing pipelines
         (2nd (second-pass stream))
         (third-pass quad :t1 (col 1st) :t2 (col 2nd)))
  :resources
  (2nd (make-fbo :c (v! 10 20))))

;; may have to be specific so I can assume types

(defpipeline compound (stream)
    (g-> (1st (first-pass stream)) ;; and this is composing pipelines
         (2nd (second-pass stream))
         (third-pass quad :t1 (col 1st) :t2 (col 2nd)))
  :fbo (1st :c :d) (2nd :c (v! 10 20)))
