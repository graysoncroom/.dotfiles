Having vectors and matrices as unboxed arrays is lovely
the ease of get, setting and applying the data is 
just what I wanted.

However the main thing that sucks about them is that generic
functions can not specialise on them.

This means the generic math functions are to slow and ugly as
well. I cant think of a decent way around this right now.
It really needs a fixed length datatype for working with that 
I can specialise on.

Bah, gonna be one for stackoverflow I think.
