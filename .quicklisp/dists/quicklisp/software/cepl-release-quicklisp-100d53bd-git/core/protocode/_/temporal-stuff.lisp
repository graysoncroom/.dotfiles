;; nope not like that.. temporal predicates must be like regular
;; predicates (listp a) says whether a is a list. (within a x y)
;; needs to return whether the temporal lambda 'a' is within x
;; and y (for whatever that means!).
;;
;; really?...is that what I mean?
;; temporal lambdas should work just like regular lambda
;; you give them arguments and they work as long as they satisfy
;; a temporal predicate.
;;
;; For a temporal predicate to work there must be time, or rather
;; a time source which the predicate uses to evaluate whether to
;; execute.

;; there are two things a temporal predicate must return:
;;
;; - t or nil saying whether the predicate has been met
;; - t or nil saying whether the predicate will ever be met again
;;
;; these are returned using values so that you can ignore the
;; latter if you choose. The latter is essential for, for the
;; lack of a better phrase, temporal garbage collection.
;;
;; for a temporal predicate to work against a temporal lambda
;; it is going to have to look inside the lexical scope of the
;; closure...this sounds ugly.

;; time-buffer - converts absolute time to relative time
;; time-cache - converts relative time to absolute time
;;
;; both of these have time sources.
;; time-cache can be made using time-buffer so may not be equal
;; in 'specialness'
;;
;; need time sources ..we have absolute, its
;; #'get-internal-real-time.

;; time buffer makes the absolute #'get-internal-real-time into

   Temporal lambdas are quite simply 'lambdas with an expiry date!'

   When you call the lambda it will only evaluate it's body if the
   conditions of the predicate are met. When the conditions are not
   met the lambda will return nil
   For example you could specify that the temporal lambda only work
   for 20 seconds.
   Of course in the above example, after the 20 seconds has passed
   the temporal lambda will never evaluate again. In this state it
   is said to have expired, when a temporal lambda that has expired
   is called it emits a 'temporally-expired' condition. This can be
   caught to allow you to clean up expired tlambdas."
