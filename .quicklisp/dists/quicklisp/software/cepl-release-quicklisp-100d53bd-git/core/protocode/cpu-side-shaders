We should implement glsl functionality in lisp so we can test things using the repl.
Also we have full type information so the code can be littered with 'the' type declarations.
We can also then look into auto offloading certain task if the gpu-arrays are available,
pushing the results to the gpu in order to finish the job.

Mainly though it is about testing, I'd like to be able to run my implicit surface functions
locally to perform sanity checks.

I'm not sure how far this idea could go but it can certainly grow as time passes.
