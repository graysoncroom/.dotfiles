              15:08:55 : Say you have a triglyph
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyph from a certain
              kind of marble (3D texture) and another smaller from
              the same kind -- you dont want to scale the texture
              alongside the geometry; it might make sense to
              perform this kind of scaling on the mesh-level of
00:36 <LG3P0> abstraction, not on the lower level.

              14:41:53 : Just my $.02: Mesh might be a good base
              concept depending on the level of abstraction. It
              might have sense for one level to use it as a base
              concept then to pass it to a lower level to decompose
              it to its base concepts (eg. triangles).
