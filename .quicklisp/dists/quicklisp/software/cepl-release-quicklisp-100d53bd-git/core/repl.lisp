This function is a legacy item at this stage, but is still here as it feels
nice.

It calls #'initialize-cepl to make a resizable window and prints out a message
in the repl.
")

  (defun init
      "
This is how we initialize CEPL. It is important to do this before using any api
that touches the gpu.

When you call this it does a few things:
- Asks the host to initialize itself
- Asks the host for an opengl context and window
- Wraps the gl-context in CEPL's own context object
- Sets up some internals systems

And finally returns t.

CEPL is now ready to use.

  (defun quit

Call this to shutdown CEPL.

As well as its own internal work, CEPL will ask the host to shut itself down.
")

  (defun step-host
      "
Call this to ask the host update its own internals.

This description is a bit nebulous as cepl doesnt impose what the host should do
when this call is made; however it is usual to call #'step-host every tick of
a main-loop and so often hosts will use this to do per-tick jobs like polling
for input events.
")

      "
Call this ask the host to swap the buffers of the default framebuffer.

We usually do this when we have finished drawing a given frame.

  (defun cls

CLS is here as it reminds me of qbasic and that makes me happy.

It calls #'clear and #'swap twice so dont use this in your actually rendering
code. It can be handy though if you want to clear the screen from the repl.
