  "Use this function to get the current power supply details.

Returns the current power state, seconds remaining, and percent remaining.
- Power state will be one of: :unknown, :on-battery, :no-battery, :charging, :charged
- Seconds will be -1 if a value can't be determined or you're not running on battery.
- Percent remaining will be a value between 0 and 100, or -1 if a value can't be determined 
  or you're not running on battery.

You should never take a battery status as absolute truth. 
Batteries (especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the 
values reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports. 
It's not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it reports, 
or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc.

Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power state, 
you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes until they 
seem to be stable for a few seconds."
