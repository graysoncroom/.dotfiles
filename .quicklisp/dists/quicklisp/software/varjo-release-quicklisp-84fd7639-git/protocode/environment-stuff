Ok so need to sort out a few things:
* macros
* compiler macros
* functions (regular and special)

macros kill functions
functions kill macros
compiler macros dont kill anything

Only kill in non-global environments, it will just shadow ...hmm
well we dont want to shadow progn...Maybe we say no function definintions
that shadow special functions. Thats makes some sence.

Need to make a sorting system for functions so we can order them by importance
we need this is so we can call special functiosn WITHOUT firt processing the
args as this is causing the walk nightmare that we are currently seeing.
