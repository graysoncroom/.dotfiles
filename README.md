# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

I will be implementing a dotfile auto installer whenever I get some free time. There are already scripts out there that do exactly this, but I am lazy and would rather write one than read someone else's documentation. Fight me.

The reason the proect is 98% java is because I have a source copy of the Java Api in my .vim folder. This is used for pulling imports in vim with the library javaIMP. Besides those files, there is no java being used.
