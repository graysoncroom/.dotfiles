# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

I will be implementing a dotfile auto installer whenever I get some free time. There are already scripts out there that do exactly this, but I am lazy and would rather write one than read someone else's documentation. Fight me.

The reason the proect is 98% java is because I have a source copy of the Java Api in my .generic-vim-javaImp directory. This is used for pulling imports in vim with the library javaIMP. Besides those files, there is no java being used.

At the moment I just "ln -s dotfiles/file ." on all the config files when I install my configs to a new machine.
