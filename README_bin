These are just a couple binaries that I may need to setup a new machine rapidly.

The program binaries here are for your convience, not to make it hard to look at the source code.
Most of the programs are available everywhere and I recommend you install your own versions of the
software when possible.

Contact me (info on github profile) if you have questions about software or you wish to be pointed
in direction of the program source code!

webcreekTaskLogger is a program for my work and it is closed source. You have to have unique company
password in order to use it. These passwords routinely get changed so I would not bother trying to
use it. It logs my hours I am working and takes screenshots of my screen when I am completing a
'task'.

The software may not be the newest version. Please install your programs from your local repository 
if at all possible.

I use this for myself. You can use these if you want. I would avoid them because I do not include
source code with them and you don't know me.
